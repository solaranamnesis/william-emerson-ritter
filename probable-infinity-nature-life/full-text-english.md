# Foreword.

The essays constituting this booklet partake of the nature of ancient history in that all have been in manuscript several years. The oldest and longest, that on the question of the infinity of nature, was mostly written in 1912, but some of it still earlier. But the mere matter of dates does not show the full measure of the ancient history character of the ideas presented. Were I to treat the same topics systematically now, almost certainly a product considerably different from that actually presented would be the outcome. However, the basal conceptions would be the same; and history, even ancient history, has its intrinsic worths, one of these being that quite over and above all that is _said_ in the record, there is the fact of the place which the record holds in the time-series into which all similar records necessarily fall. To illustrate, the various chroniclings and meditatings and generalizings on the life of a people produced by many writers and scattered through many years and centuries, constitute a history --- a sort of super-history --- of the writers. Indeed, to the student of evolution in the truly organic sense, this super-history may almost be said to be more important than the written record. The student of man's efforts to interpret the organic world of which he is a part may well find more interest in the question of why and how Milton produced such a story as that of the Creation and Fall of Man than in anything actually contained in the story. From this standpoint the story may interest him as keenly, may mean as much to him, as does Darwin's attempt to account for man's origin.

It is almost as much on account of the super-history furnished by these essays as on account of what is said in them that I am now publishing them. They were not written with any definite purpose of publication. The ones on spontaneous generation and multiple causes were prepared as addresses for scientific societies. That on the infinity of nature was written mainly to enable me to see where my biological development was tending as touching other domains of knowledge. To state more specifically why I now publish the essays essentially as they were written, I find on approaching the completion of the _Unity of the Organism_, that I need the essays in print, partly as record and partly as super-record. What I am writing now in the larger work, I want to attach directly to what I wrote earlier about the "origin of life" and to do so without rewriting the old essay and incorporating it as a section in the later book.

The chief present significance, as I now see, of the essays as super-record, lies in the stage of development exhibited of the organismal hypothesis of consciousness in which the _Unity of the Organism_ culminates. If any of my readers become seriously interested in that hypothesis, they will quite surely be interested to know just how the conceptions of conscious psychic life set forth in the discussion of that hypothesis, are a growth and differentiation from conceptions set forth in the essay on the infinity of nature. And such readers may be approximately as much interested as I am in the fact that what is said in the older essay had lain unread and largely forgotten as to details from 1912 to 1918.

# Are We Obliged to Suppose That the Spontaneous Origin of Life Ever Occurred?*

I have no new facts to present on this much-belabored subject. This admission may seem to disqualify me for a Sigma Xi address, the usual understanding being that such an address should be based on experimental investigations by the speaker himself. So my venture raises an interesting question: May a scientific study be original and useful even though it deals entirely with old and well-known observations and experiments? Does scientific research consist in the discovery and announcement of concrete facts, and in that alone?

*) Written as an address for the University of California scientific society, Sigma Xi, and read before the California chapter in 1914, and the Texas chapter in 1916.

The view expressed by Claude Bernard that "Science does not consist in facts, but in the conclusions which we draw from them," is, I think, held by all men of science. But the view carries an important implication which seems to be little noticed, namely, that if generalizations and conclusions are as essential to science as are facts, then they, as such, need critical examination just as objective facts do. This means, stated briefly, that critical, consistent science must examine its own knowledge-getting processes no less carefully than it examines facts. It means that science needs theories of knowledge --- at least of its own kind of knowledge --- no less than it needs theories of nature.

Failure by men of science to recognize clearly the distinction indicated is responsible, in my judgment, for much confused thinking in science. The problem in hand is a conspicuous example of this confusion. When biologists affirm that the spontaneous generation of life at some time somewhere is a logical necessity of the evolution theory, they appear not to see that the affirmation really concerns not a theory of _nature_, but a theory of the _knowledge_ of nature.

I believe, therefore, that an examination of prevailing views on the query which is our subject is as essentially scientific as an experimental research to the same end. And I feel the more justified in dealing with the problem thus, in that all who have discussed it during the last forty years, more or less, have really had to go on much the same observational basis. Objective discovery has contributed exceedingly little to the solution of the problem since the great controversy of the Pasteur-Pouchet period, culminating in Tyndall's memoir of 1875, ended in the complete overthrow of the theory of spontaneous generation as then held. It will be safe to assume that everybody admits that the dictum, _Omne vivum ex vivo_, stands on as secure an inductive foundation as do the doctrines of gravitation and of conservation of energy, so far as the life of today is concerned. Like these it has stood the severest of all tests, that of unlimited application in the affairs of civilized mankind. Every piece of canned food the preservation of which depends on hermetic closure after the expulsion or sterilization of air, and every aseptic surgical operation are confirmations of the dictum.

These preliminaries lead to a closer formulation of the problem as we are to treat it: How comes it that a great number of scientific men believe that something has taken place in nature when there is not a particle of direct evidence that it has taken place, while on the contrary, there is a vast body of evidence tending to prove that it has not taken place? Exception may be taken to the statement that there is no direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that the living has ever originated genuinely _de novo_ from the non-living. I must consequently justify the assertion. What I have to say will be assembled around a distinction between direct and indirect evidence. The direct evidence is derived from immediate observation upon, or experience with the production of living beings. All the evidence we have of this sort, and I reiterate my reference to its vastness, is that organisms always come into existence from preceding organisms of their own kind. All the evidence of _biology proper_ is to this purport. By indirect evidence I mean evidence derived from observation and reasoning on certain aspects of organisms _other_ than those of their mode of coming into existence. The most important kinds of indirect evidence are chemico-physical, and pertain chiefly to the chemical composition of organisms, the metabolic processes taking place within them, and certain of their corporeal activities.

It would be possible to show by several lines of consideration, that almost all chemico-physical studies on organisms bear only _indirectly_, so far as they bear at all, on the problem of the ultimate origin of life. But it will suffice to point out that such studies scarcely touch the central point of the problem. They ignore that attribute of organisms in virtue of which they give rise to others of the same kind. I say this with the whole round of such highly interesting researches as those on artificial parthenogenesis in mind. The experiments in this field always begin, bear in mind, with the ripe or nearly ripe germ-cells, and these, do not forget, are _derived from some organism_. As to how these germ-cells came into existence, the researches never so much as ask, nor do they throw the faintest direct light on the question. Their aim is to show not how the egg came to exist, but, once it does exist, what it may be made to do and how it does it.

Of course investigators in this realm know well enough how distant and round-about and inferential is the road from observation on the reproductive cells of an animal, to conclusions touching the primal origin of animals generally; but from all we gather it is clear that the unschooled in the ways of nature and in the methods of science do not understand this. On behalf of health and sobriety in the general intelligence of the community relative to biological matters, teachers of science ought to show pupils the vast chasm that yawns between observations on development of a sea-urchin's eggs, to illustrate, and conclusions as to how sea-urchins, to say nothing about all other animals, arose in the first instance. There is a considerable body of _indirect knowledge_ which is undoubtedly more or less favorable to the hypothesis of the origin of living beings at some time, somewhere, without the intermediation of prior living beings. Let us look at some of this knowledge.

Certain mixtures of inorganic ingredients, as heavy oil and pulverized salts, potassium bichromate for example, present structural features and movements both of locomotion and internal change closely resembling the structure and activities of such simple beings as the amoeba and the slime moulds. From this one is impelled to ask, may it not be possible by sufficient patience in this mixing of non-living substances to finally hit upon a combination whose likeness to living substance would be so close as to be wholly indistinguishable from it --- in a word, so close as to be really identical with it? If such a combination could be found by artifice, why not suppose that it might have been chanced upon by nature in the long and ceaseless course of the translocations and interactions that are so characteristic of nature?

Again, great numbers of compounds, as urea, sugars, fats, even proteids, are now produced in the chemical laboratory by processes wholly unconnected with those taking plcuie in the bodies of living beings. If then by such relatively simple inorganic means the processes of life may be so far duplicated, is it not reasonable to suppose that in nature, with its vastly greater resources and its heedlessness of time, similar inorganic operations might have accomplished much more, --- might indeed have gone the whole way and produced not only various essential constituents of living beings, but the beings themselves? Such reasoning has plausibility, even conclusive force with many minds, particularly with minds that are not over-critical and already in the possession of general theories to which the reasoning is congenial.

Taking account of all the evidence bearing on the question of the origin of life, two quite different conclusions are indicated: 1. that organisms have always originated from parents, 2. that somewhere and at some time, some organisms have originated without parents.

Do not fail to notice at this point the real inwardness of the familiar assertion that it is "logically necessary" to suppose life originated _de novo_ sometime, and I wish this appeal to logic might reveal to us workers in objective science the peril in the habit of falling back on logic. It is logically necessary to suppose life originated in time if our reasoning starts from premises that makes it necessary, but not otherwise. Logic has to do primarily with the concatenation of ideas, that is, with creations of the mind; and only secondarily with the creations of nature. The attempt to make nature genuinely subject to a system of logic is the very essence of all subjectivistic philosophies, and for scientific men to pursue investigations on living beings under guidance of the belief that such beings originated in a specified way, because logic demands that they should so originate, is to cast inductive science out of the laboratory window and enthrone deductive science in its place.

So far as logic is concerned, two courses are open as touching the question of the origin of life. 1. We may investigate the phenomena of living beings without making any formal hypothesis as to whether there was a time in the remote past when no such beings existed. 2. If we decide that an hypothesis is desirable, we have the choice between two hypotheses. a. We can make an hypothesis that they actually did begin, in the fullest meaning of the word, at some time, or b. that they have always arisen much as we see them arising now. We may choose between these two hypotheses: Organisms began, truly, in time; or the time during which they have been coming into existence as we now see them doing, is of endless length. Or stating the alternatives in language not involving the word "time," we have: a. Some organisms have arisen without parents; or b. the succession of organisms standing in the relation of parent to offspring is of endless continuance.

My views as to what biology had best do about the two courses above indicated is: Some hypothesis is desirable as a guide and stimulus to research. Indeed unreserved commitment to the evolution doctrine almost necessitates this. As between the two hypotheses open to us, I believe that of the endless continuance in the past of the production of organisms by parents would better be adopted as our "working hypothesis." The superior claim of this hypothesis over the other is distinct enough when the usual tests are applied for determining the relative values of rival hypotheses. The endless-succession hypothesis is favored over the no-parent hypothesis by the positive evidence bearing on the case; by the nature of the difficulties in the way of establishing each; and by the relative usefulness of each. To show why the endless-succession hypothesis is more tenable and better is the main aim of this address.

First as to the positive, observational evidence in the case. I have already called attention to the secure place in science of the dictum _omne vivum ex vivo_. The full weight of the evidence on which this rests is hardly appreciated even by biologists, and I am convinced that it cannot be justly appraised without a closer critique of the nature of observational evidence than we are wont to make. Into such a critique it is impossible to go at length now. I must be satisfied to assert in an apparently dogmatic way that if one sees clearly not only the _difference_, but also the _relation_ between the inductive and the deductive methods in science, he will see that the simply enormous body of direct evidence to the effect that organisms come into existence from parents and in no other way, far outweighs the indirect evidence that some may have arisen without parents, and that it also out-weighs the _a priori_ difficulties presented by the fact that this positive evidence points to a literally endless succession of parents and offspring.

I would like to call your attention to an historic aspect of the controversy not often attended to. All man's reasonings about nature, no matter how crude, contain an _a priori_, or hypothetical element, so that all real advance in knowledge of nature, in science, involves the testing and correcting of preconceptions. In earlier ages men's reasonings concerning the origin of living beings found no difficulty in the notion that plants and animals might arise without parents; so the effect of the whole course of investigation touching this aspect of organisms has been one of correcting earlier conceptions on this subject. The contemporaries of Virgil and Ovid had no difficulty in accepting the view that bees arise from the flesh of bullocks, frogs from slime, and mice from old rags. Harvey's declaration that all animals come from eggs, and Redi's denial that maggots are generated by decaying meat, were vigorously combatted. Historically as well as factually the "logical necessity" felt today that some living beings must have come from things not living, _is a remnant of the earlier necessity felt by everybody for believing that almost all living beings must (or might) come from non-living things_.

The relative difficulties in the way of the two hypotheses we will now examine more closely. Consider the more general difficulty first. To many persons the conception of a truly endless succession of parents and offspring seems more difficult than that of a succession actually beginning at some time in the past, so the former is forthwith rejected in favor of the latter. Arrhenius has indicated the direction in which the answer to this question lies, though he has not, to my knowledge, considered it in detail. We can as well become accustomed, he says, to think of the eternity of life as of the eternity of matter. I would maintain that the supposed necessity of accepting the idea that matter is eternal, but of rejecting the idea that life is eternal is a _mere habit of thought_ --- a kind of determination which no scientific man would defend. There is unquestionably great difficulty in getting a clear conception of a succession of organisms related to one another as parent to offspring, extending through infinite time; but the difficulty is not different in fundamentals from that of getting a clear, scientific conception of the infinity of nature in any of its aspects. Custom and a sort of intellectual laziness enable us to speak the words "eternity of matter" glibly enough. But as long as any mental alertness remains to us, we may jolt ourselves out of our thought-siesta on this subject by querying: Under _what form_ has matter existed from all eternity? For example, have oxygen and iron and phosphorus existed from all eternity just as we see them today? I do not ask these questions with any expectation, even with any desire that anybody will be ready with an absolute answer. All I am concerned about is that you shall reflect upon the relative difficulties in the conceptions that the oxide of iron, for instance, has existed forever while organic beings must have begun, actually _de novo_, sometime, somewhere. The difficulty in the case of the infinite series of organisms is surely different from that presented by the infinite series in inorganic nature, but the difference is only an extension of the difference between the living and the non-living all along the line. To those who think on problems of nature in a truly scientific way, the "greater difficulty" argument against the so-called "pansparma" hypothesis can have no weight.

The second difficulty is that presented by the problem, not of how life began anywhere whatever, but of how it began on our earth. A sharp distinction between these two problems is necessitated by the present state of knowledge in the three fields of astronomy, chemistry, and biology. There is, it would seem, ample ground on which to rest the hypothesis that living beings exist on many celestial bodies as well as on our own. But how strong is the evidence in support of the schoolbook pronouncement that "at some time in prehistoric ages the first living thing appeared from a source which was not living"? I believe that an impartial consideration of all facts does not warrant any such pronouncement. No really critical biologist would put it into an elementary text-book, nor teach it in any way, but least of all to beginners in biology. I would insist that the difficulties in the way of understanding how life began on earth have no more right to impose a limitation on our belief as to the origin of organisms from parents, than the difficulties in the way of understanding how gravitation could act in an absolute vacuum have a right to impose a limitation on our belief of the universal attraction of bodies. The assumptions that the spontaneous origin of life does not take place in nature now because the conditions of the earth are unfavorable for it, but that in some past time the conditions were favorable, so that the thing actually did occur, are not warranted by the facts. The limiting conditions for the maintenance and propagation of organic beings as we actually know them, justify to my mind, the supposition that if ever living things arose _de novo_ from non-living things they may do so now. Consider the matter of temperature which is allowed to be one of the most important of all the environmental conditions of organisms. The average above which organisms are killed by heat is usually taken as about 40° C., and there seems no good ground for supposing that temperatures favorable for the _maintenance_ of life should not also be favorable for the primal origination of life, if such be in any wise possible. The assumption frequently made that the higher general temperatures of the earth which are believed to have obtained in earlier geological ages would be more favorable than the present temperature conditions for the original production of organic beings from inorganic substances, appears to be quite gratuitous.

The basal chemico-physical processes of organisms such as photo-sjmthesis, enzymic action, protoplasmic movement, and cell-division, proceed most typically at temperatures ranging from 10° or 12° C. to 20° or 25° C., and perhaps 30° or 35° C., these being ordinary temperatures on many parts of the earth. And what real reasons have we for supposing that conditions of light, oxygen, water, and salt, favorable for supporting life, should not also be favorable for the primal origination of it? So far as I can see, the only reason offered by the protagonists of the primal-favoring-conditions hypothesis is that the evidence at hand is not favorable for such origin now. If living beings have ever arisen from non-living substances, they may reasonably be supposed to be doing so at present. If this reasoning is correct, it would seem as though the natural conditions favorable for such mode of origination might be reproduced in the laboratory.

Conceived in this way the problem of "spontaneous generation" is quite different from that which occupied the attention of Pouchet, Liebig, Pasteur, Tyndall, and others of their period. These investigators were aiming to determine whether living beings may appear in culture media containing organic substances of one kind and another, if sources of germ _inoculation of these media be rigidly excluded_. The experiments of that era were not, it must be recognized, devised for the purpose of testing the possibility of the origin of organic beings in solutions containing _only_ the _inorganic elements_ essential to the constitution of the organisms. This is the problem that Dr. H. Charlton Bastian worked at for years; and however much or little reliance may be placed on his manipulations and conclusions, it would seem that his main idea as to object and method is sound, and that if the problem is to be solved at all, it will have to be attacked in accordance with this general plan. Bastian made solutions in distilled water of sodium silicate (or more recently, of colloidal silica), ammonic phosphate, phosphoric acid and iron pernitrate. Small quantities of these he placed in glass tubes which he sealed and subjected to temperatures of from 100° C. to 135° C. Then he exposed the tubes to ordinary daylight or direct sunlight at room temperatures for varying periods of time, extending to several months. His results are altogether too remarkable to be accepted at once by any even half critical biologist. The Royal Society refused to publish his later work, and if he never presented anything more convincing than what is contained in papers published elsewhere, he really had no ground for feeling himself unjustly treated. In the first place, he fell far short of proving that the objects he got were organisms. They were almost entirely motionless according to his own account. Although they are said to have "multiplied," no detailed description of anything like cell-division is given. The photographic figures furnished in abundance show many things which resemble organisms, but structural details are almost wholly lacking. Finally, while he got what he called bacteria, torulae, and even fungi of familiar species, he supposed silicon to replace carbon in their chemical make-up, since, as it will be noticed, the compounds with which he starts make no provision for this element. Nevertheless, if one is going to prove the origin of organic beings from inorganic substances, he must start with inorganic substances. This is so obviously sound that several English bio-chemists are turning their attention to the matter, and it is greatly to be hoped that the whole field will be worked over with the thoroughness which the importance and intricacy of the subject demands, and modem laboratory facilities and methods are able to furnish.

Looking at the problem of the _de novo_ origin of living beings from the standpoint of biology proper, that is, from the standpoint of _living_ organisms, I do not see how the methods of ordinary chemical manipulation can get solid basis even for making a start toward its solution. I have never understood how chemists could see in the fact of their ability to produce in the laboratory some or all the compounds which they may get from organic beings, ground for hoping that by these methods they might prove that living beings could arise in nature from inorganic substances, or that it might be possible to produce living beings by similar means. To reason that because it is possible to produce in the laboratory the chemical compounds found in organic beings, it may be possible to produce the living organisms from which these compounds are derived, is not unlike reasoning that because it is possible to produce in the laboratory compounds taken from the earth, it may be possible to produce an earth in the laboratory. The similarity between these cases is by no means far-fetched. In order to produce any natural object you have to produce all its attributes. The attribute of the earth which makes the suggestion to produce an earth artificially seem ridiculous is its size. But really when you reflect, are not the difficulties in the way of producing the attributes of the organism in virtue of which it is alive about as insurmountable as are those in the way of producing the size of the earth? To make this query concrete, consider what would be involved in producing artificially the attribute by virtue of which organisms propagate their kind. The fact should never be neglected that heredity as a biological conception implies not merely that each individual organism has the ability to produce, or participate in producing, another of its kind, but that it itself was produced by another of its kind. How are you going to produce artificially an object, one of the main attributes of which is that of being produced by another object of its own kind? Put in that form, the problem manifestly involves an absurdity. As far as concerns practical solution it is much the same as that of producing perpetual motion; that is, of producing a machine capable of at the same time using up and keeping its own substance and energy ; in other words, the familiar problem of lifting one's self by his boot straps.

The way this difficulty is avoided by those who still cling to the spontaneous generation hypothesis is very instructive. Different writers pursue different courses. In the first place there are those who hold, as G. H. Lewes did, that "the link which unites all organisms is not always the common bond of heritage, but the uniformity of organic laws acting under uniform conditions"; that heredity is, in other words, not an original and essential attribute of organisms, or at least of organic matter, but something acquired in the course of evolution after the first organic compounds had arisen. This seems to be Bastian's view. It is also held by Professor Benjamin Moore and undoubtedly by many other biochemists and physiologists. It would be interesting to know how a biologist who holds this view would convince himself and his biological colleagues that a particular substance was genuinely living if it could not grow and reproduce. Is it not exactly here that Bastian's enterprise foundered?

Again there are those, like Jacques Loeb, who while regarding heredity as a truly primal attribute of organisms, still put it aside as presenting no great obstacle. In his book, _The Mechanical Conception of Life_, Loeb says that "fertilization and heredity... are specific for living organisms and without analogues in inanimate nature." The key inquiry concerning this view is: If heredity is specific for living organisms, is it also specific for the most fundamental of the _living_ materials of organisms? It seems to me a great deal of confused thinking has resulted from the prevalent habit of speaking of "living matter," "organic substance" and so on, as though these were something quite apart from or antecedent to organisms. The very conception of "living" or "organic" substance is, as I understand, substance found in living beings. To apply the term living to substances which had never been in any way dependent upon a living being would be to deprive the word of its most fundamental meaning. Suppose, for example, an inorganic colloid were to be produced so similar to some living colloid substance as to be indistinguishable from it in any observable attribute. I fail to see how it could be pronounced living, imtil it should have proved itself capable of cooperating and interacting with other substances to make a living being. These are common-place, homely truths, but not to be denied or ignored because common-place.
